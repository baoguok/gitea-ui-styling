## custom/public/img
Location of things like the default (navbar) Gitea logo. Just put a image in there named 'gitea-sm.png' (navbar logo) and/or favicon.png for your favicon obviously. 

## CSS
Custom CSS just goes in the custom/public folder. Naming it index.css makes it load instead of the default index.css.
